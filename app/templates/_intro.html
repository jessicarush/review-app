  This is a personal study tool that I built to help encourage regular review in order to retain new concepts learned. It tracks your review sessions and self-assessed comprehension level to recommend which topics should be reviewed next. It's built to work with a github repository of study notes & topics <a href="https://github.com/jessicarush/python-notes" class="inline inline--dark" target="_blank" title="My Python notes on Github.">like this one</a>.
